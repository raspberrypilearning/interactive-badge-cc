## Introduction

You are going to make an interactive badge, that will show your mood to your friends.

__Instructions__: If you're reading this online, press __A__ on the micro:bit below to display a happy face, and __B__ to show a sad face.

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use input events to execute sequences of instructions, by making an interactive badge. Pressing the buttons on the micro:bit will change the image that's displayed.

## Resources
For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:90418-17495-16581-63753](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:90418-17495-16581-63753), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Interactive-Badge.hex

## Learning Objectives
+ Inputs (`on button pressed`);
+ Sequencing instructions.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Displaying a sad face" - adding code to a new `on button pressed` event;
+ "Create your own interactive badge!" - consolidation on skills learnt in this project.
